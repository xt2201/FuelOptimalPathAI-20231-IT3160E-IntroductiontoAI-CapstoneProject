This project is implemented using multiple different algorithms.
We have already set up the environment for this problem.
To find a solution for this project, please follow these steps:
1. Open the "input.txt" file and copy any input (we have provided 5 sample inputs, which consist of the number of levels, the number of positions on each level, and the number of stations, respectively).
2. Open the "main.py" file and run it, then paste the input you copied in the previous step.
The resulting output will be the solution for the problem (path, distance moved), appearing in file “output.txt”, and the maps visualizing the solution will appear.
